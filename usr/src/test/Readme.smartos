I) Introduction

The procedure to run the illumos tests under SmartOS is unlike that for
other distributions because of the zone-centric nature of the distribution,
and because there is no built-in package management for the global zone.

This Readme assumes you will run the tests in the global zone, as root.
Although it is possible to run some of the tests within a non-global zone, as a
user configured within that zone, that approach is not described here.

Some test suites, such as the ZFS tests, assume there are available disks to
use for the test run. This configuration is not currently available on a
standard SmartOS installation, where all of the disks are already setup in the
"zones" zpool, so these tests are not runnable at this time. The ZFS tests
also are required to run as a non-root user, and that is non-standard for a
SmartOS global zone, where any user created is lost on reboot.

II) Setup to Run the Tests

1) The tests currently require python26 to run, so you need to install this in
   the global zone. The easiest way to do this is with pkgsrc using the
   following procedure:

   a) Get a copy of the following bootstrap tarball onto the test machine:
      https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/packages/SmartOS/bootstrap/bootstrap-2014Q4-multiarch.tar.gz

   b) Install the bootstrap tarball:
      # gzcat bootstrap-2014Q4-multiarch.tar.gz | (cd /; tar -xpf -)

   c) Install python26:
      pkgin in python26

2) You need to get the tests from your build machine onto the test machine's
   global zone. This can be done in whatever way is easiest for you. Here is
   one simple way:

   a) On your build machine, in your fully built smartos-live proto area,
      create a tarball of the test directory:
      % cd proto/opt
      % tar czf ../opt.tgz *


   b) Copy the tarball from the build machine to the test machine running
      SmartOS (the next step assumes you placed the tarball into the /zones
      directory).

3) In the global zone on your test machine, install the tests.

   # cd /opt
   # tar xf /zones/opt.tgz

III) Run the Tests

Now that setup is complete, you can run the tests using the normal procedure.
For example:

    # /opt/util-tests/bin/utiltest
or
    # /opt/os-tests/bin/ostest

IV) Running New Tests

During development, if you are creating or updating new tests, you can repeat
steps 2 and 3 as often as necessary to make the new tests available on the test
machine.
