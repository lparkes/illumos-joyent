 * realloc() is itself abused (e.g., if a consumer repeatedly expands and
 * contracts the same memory buffer), the net result can be less efficient
 * than a much more naive realloc() implementation.  And if native Linux is
 * suboptimal in this case, we are deeply pathological, having not
 * historically supported mremap() for anonymous mappings at all.  To make
 * this at least palatable, we not only support remap for anonymous mappings
 * (see lx_remap_anon(), below), we also cache the metadata associated with
 * these mappings to save both the reads from /proc and the libmapmalloc
 * alloc/free.  We implement the anonymous metadata cache with
 * lx_remap_anoncache, an LRU cache of prmap_t's that correspond to anonymous
